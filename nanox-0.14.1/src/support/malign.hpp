/* This macro computes the memory offset for a given element (ce) with taking into account its own *type*

 *    |++++pe+++|···|++ce++|          refer to previous element and only *type* parameter refers
 *    +---------+---+------+          to current element (which we want to align). This is because
 *    ^         ^   ^                 we want to add padding to the previous structure in order to
 *    base   size   align (return)    aling the current one.
 *
 * If we use this macro with *base* and *size* of the last element (and with any type given as a parameter
 * we get the size of the whole chunk.
